# Project Statement - Expense_Splitter
## 1. Project Title
Expense Splitter - Java Console Application

## 2. Objective
To develop a simple and efficient system to record shared expenses among a group of friends, split them equally, maintain balances and allow settlement using basic Java and OOP concepts.

## 3. Problem Description
Managing shared expenses in groups often becomes confusing, especially when multiple people pay at different times. Manual calculations lead to errors and misunderstandings about who owes whom. A simple automated system is needed to track contributions and balance amounts accurately.

## 4. Proposed Solution
The system allows users to:
* Add friends
* Add expenses
* Auto-split expenses
* View summary
* Settle balances
* Save & load data  
The project is modular, easy to extend and follows OOP best practices.

## 5. Modules
1. Friend Module - stores friend's name and balance
2. Expense Module - represents an individual expense
3. Expense Manager Module - core logic of splitting and updating balances
4. Validator Module - ensures valid input
5. File Handler Module - saves and loads data
6. Main Module - user interface

## 6. Tools & Technologies
* Java (Core)
* OOP
* Collections (ArrayList)
* File I/O (BufferedReader, BufferedWriter)

## 7. Outcome
* Simplifies shared expense management
* Ensures fairness in splitting
* Stores data persistently
* Demonstrates knowledge of multi-class Java programming

## 8. Conclusion
This project successfully meets its objectives by delivering a straightforward and reliable expense management system. It showcases the use of Java OOP principles, collections and file handling while solving a real-world problem with a simple console application.
